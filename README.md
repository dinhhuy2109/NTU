This is a git repository storing all the tests, demos that I implemented.

TOPP-SO3
------------
TOPP FOR RIGID-BODY MOTIONS. 
This library includes tools to plan fast trajectories on the the space of rotation matrices SO(3) and the space of three-dimensional rigid body motions SE(3) under kinodynamic constraints (bounds on angular velocities, accelerations and torques) in a cluttered environment.
Please follow the link below for the paper and installation instruction:

Particle Filter
------------
This implementation is for touch-based object estimation using Particle Filter.
